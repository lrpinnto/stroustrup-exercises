// CHAPTER 24 EX 10

// How random is your default_random_engine? Write a program that takes 2 integers n and d and inputs and calls randint(n) d times, recording the result.
// Output the number of draws foor each of [0:n) and "eyeball" how similar the counts are. Try with low values for n and with low values for d to see
// if drawing only a few random numbers causes obvious biases.
