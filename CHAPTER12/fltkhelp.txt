Download latest stable release from FLTK (I'm using 1.3.7) https://www.fltk.org/software.php
Unzip contents to somewhere in your PC. We will use these to compile FLTK.
Follow your OS readme instruction file for compilation (should be included with the zip folder)
If everything went smoothly, you should be able to run demo/test
If you are using g++ on unix (ubuntu) like me, you'll need to run "g++ `fltk-config --cxxflags` filename.cpp `fltk-config --ldflags` -o filename" to compile your code.
If you are compiling with the GUI header files from the book (GUI.h, Simple_window.h ...) you'll need to use "g++ -w -Wall -std=c++11 Graph.cpp Window.cpp GUI.cpp Simple_window.cpp MY_CPP_FILE.cpp `fltk-config --ldflags --use-images` -o MY_EXECUTABLE"
If you are using my code directly "g++ -w -Wall -std=c++11 ../sourcesgui/Graph.cpp ../sourcesgui/Window.cpp ../sourcesgui/GUI.cpp '../sourcesgui/Simple_window.cpp' C12DRILL.cpp `fltk-config --ldflags --use-images` -o C12DRILL"
I also took some of the header files from the FLTK folder that were needed to compile my code. This might be different for you though. I've placed these files on sourcesgui/Fl/ within this project.
All files uploaded here have been debugged and work on my current dist Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS.
You should be able to just run this code without any debugging assuming you are running a similar setup to mine (Visual Code + g++). Make sure you are also using the same FLTK version as me.
